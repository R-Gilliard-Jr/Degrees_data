- Class: text
  Output: 
    The following question is about using the pipe.

- Class: script
  Output: Use the pipe to sum x and y and assign the value to z
  AnswerTests: test_sum_x_y()
  Script: sum_x_y.R
  Hint: 
    Remember that assignment can be written `<-` and the pipe `%>%`.
    You will need one of each to answer this question.

- Class: text
  Output: 
    You should continue to use the pipe throughout these exercises.
    Notice that the there is a data frame, nyc_survey_total, that has been
    loaded into the global environment for you. This data is drawn from the
    NYC School Survey for students. You can find the full data set here
    https://infohub.nyced.org/reports/school-quality/nyc-school-survey/survey-archives.
    You'll use this data set throughout the rest of the lesson.
    
- Class: script
  Output: 
    Filter the nyc_survey_total data frame, keeping only observations
    where more at least 95% of students responded using dplyr's filter() 
    function.
  AnswerTests: test_filter_total()
  Script: filter_total.R
  Hint: Try ?filter for help with filter's syntax
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 
    Which of the following methods would allow you to see the first 5 rows
    in the nyc_survey_total data frame?
  AnswerChoices: 
    slice_head(nyc_survey_total, n = 5);slice(nyc_survey_total, c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5));
    slice(nyc_survey_total, 1:5);All of these work
  CorrectAnswer: All of these work
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= "All of these work")
  Hint: Review the slice section in Lesson 3.
  
- Class: script
  Output:
    Sort the first 5 rows of the nyc_survey_total data frame on total 
    parent response rate.
  AnswerTests: test_slice_arrange()
  Script: slice_arrange.R
  Hint: 
    Remember that the function for sorting rows is called arrange(). 
    Review the section on arrange in Lesson 3 if you need further help.
    
- Class: mult_question
  Output: What function allows sorting on descending order?
  AnswerChoices: desc;rev;asce
  CorrectAnswer: desc
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= "desc")
  Hint: Review teh arrange section of lesson 3.
    
- Class: script
  Output:
    Several columns in the nyc_survey_total data frame contain only NA values.
    Remove them using the select() function.
  AnswerTests: test_select()
  Script: select.R
  Hint: Remember to use the "-" sign to remove columns in select.
  
- Class: script
  Output:
    We're more interested in the student response rate than the parent response rate. 
    Let's rename this column and place it before the Total.Parent.Response.Rate column.
  AnswerTests: test_rename_relocate()
  Script: rename_relocate.R
  Hint: Revisit the relocate and rename sections of lesson 3.
  
- Class: script
  Output:
    Finally, let's use both mutate and summarize to find the mean of the student response
    rate divided by the parent response rate.
  AnswerTests: test_mutate_summarize()
  Script: mutate_summarize.R
  Hint: Revisit the mutate and summarize sections of lesson 3.
